# Weather App v. 3

## Author Note
While I had no issue pulling and displaying API data, for some reason conceptualizing and implementing the search history criteria for this assignment gave me a great deal of difficulty. While I'm not thilled with my design, it does function, so I want to submit this for initial review considering my repeated delays.

Aside from the design, I intend to overhaul the code for the next iteration. I have reviewed this  version with a tutor and have a much better understanding of how to leverage loops and a few new Javascript tricks for more concise code.

Any additional feedback would be greatly welcome before I modify the code for a second round of review. Many thanks!

## User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon 
representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an 
icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
